# Mitron-bank-analysis-
This project is based on the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge.
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, planned to launch a new line of credit cards. As part of the pilot analysis, a dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities was shared to identify spending behavior, income utilization, and target customer segments for credit card marketing.

As the data analyst (Peter Pandey in the case study), my task was to:
1.Analyze customer spending data using Tableau.
2.Build an interactive dashboard for the strategy and management teams.
3.Deliver data-driven insights and recommendations for credit card positioning.

Tools & Technologies
1.Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation
2.Excel / CSV – Data cleaning and preprocessing
